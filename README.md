# Sorting Hat - Hogwarts House Selector

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sorting Hat project! This interactive web application simulates the experience of being sorted into a Hogwarts house, as seen in the Harry Potter series. Using a series of questions, the app determines which of the four houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin) best suits the user's personality and traits.

## Features

- Chat-like interface for a more immersive experience
- Responsive design, working on screens from 320px to 3000px wide
- Smooth animations for messages entering and exiting the chat
- Dark mode toggle for improved user experience
- Hogwarts house selection based on user responses

## Technologies Used
